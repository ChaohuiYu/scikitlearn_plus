## Welcome to ScikitPlus

High Performance with CUDAs
Scikit-Plus provides MLPRegressor with GPU support, which is able to speed up to 12x  compared with the original MLPRegressor.

Highly Compatible with Scikit-learn
Scikit-Plusâ€˜s interface is highly compatible with scikit-learn; in most cases, it can be used as drop-in replacement.

```
from scikitlearn_plus.neural_network import MLPRegressor_cuda
from scikitlearn_plus.neural_network import MLPRegressor

# sklearn MLPRegressor sgd
regSgd = MLPRegressor(solver='sgd', alpha=1e-5,
                    hidden_layer_sizes=layer, random_state=1, max_iter=1000, verbose=True)

# scikitlearn_plus MLPRegressor
regSgd_cuda = MLPRegressor_cuda(solver='sgd', alpha=1e-5,
                    hidden_layer_sizes=layer, random_state=1, max_iter=1000, verbose=True)
